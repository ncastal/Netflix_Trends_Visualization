# Netflix_Trends_Visualization

Project on analyzing trends in Netflix shows.  Created website using html and javascript to view visualizations of trends.

Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 167 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.

The site created allows a user to take a look at the trends of shows and movies on Netflix.  On the Fun Facts page, there are visualizations looking at the differences between shows produced by Netflix and shows that were not produced by Netflix but are on its site.  The biggest difference between content produced by Netflix and content that is not produced by Netflix is the rating for the show.  A majority of the content produced by Netflix is given a TV-MA rating, almost 70%, while less than 30% of content not produced by Netflix is given a TV-MA rating.  This page also looks at the genres of shows produced by Netflix.  The data is visualized using a Anychart tag cloud, where the bigger the word, the more frequent it is.  Another visual is the bar chart looking at the amount of shows added to Netflix over time and how much of that conent is produced by Netflix.

The Most Popular Shows page allows a user to view the most popular shows on Netflix in each state on the United States.  The map was created using Mapbox.  The last page is Data, where a user can view all the data used in this project and filter out the data using the filter.
